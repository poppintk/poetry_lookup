My cat stares blankly at the wall 
Trying to hunt the light.
She flicks her tail and starts to crawl, 
Eyes focused, fur upright.

I watch her, silently, as she creeps 
Slowly towards her prey.
I remain still, as if fast asleep 
For this is not child's play.

Her moving stops, she is ready
To jump up and attack.
I see her ascend, now unsteady;  
I gasp, and she looks back.

Her eyes are chasms, black holes throughout,
And my flashlight goes quickly out.
